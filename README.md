A lightweight server clone of Azure Blob, Queue, and Table Storage that simulates most of the commands supported by it with minimal dependencies.

# Installation and Usage
## NPM
In order to run Azurite you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 6.0 installed on your system. Azurite works cross-platform on Windows, Linux, and OS X. 

After installation you can install Azurite simply with `npm` which is Node.js package management tool and which is included with every Node.js installation.

`$ npm install -g azurite`

## Running Azurite

Simply start it with the following command: 

`$ azurite -l path/to/localfolder`

This tells Azurite to store all data in a particular directory. If the `-l` option is ommitted it will use the current working directory. This also will start both blob storage and queue storage emulation in two different processes.
You can also selectively start the different storage emulators.

For Blob Storage Emulator only:

`$ azurite-blob -l path/to/azurite/workspace`

For Queue Storage Emulator only:

`$ azurite-queue`

For Table Storage Emulator only:

`$ azurite-table -l path/to/azurite/workspace`


## Nuget
Azurite is also available as Nuget package at [https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azurite/](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azurite/).
You can install it via the [Package Manager Console](https://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/using-the-package-manager-console) with the following command:
```bash
PM> Install-Package Azurite
```
This will install Azurite to your current project and also immediately start it in a dedicated console window. Note that you do not need to install Node.js since Azurite is packaged into
a single self-contained executable, thanks to [pkg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pkg).

## Docker image

### Pulling from Docker Hub
Every release of Azurite starting with version 0.9.7 is available at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/arafato/azurite/) and ready to be pulled with:
```bash
$ docker pull arafato/azurite
```
Please note that the `latest` tag will always refer to the latest release.

### Build the Docker image 
To build the Docker image yourself, execute the following:
```bash
$ docker build -t arafato/azurite .
```

### Run the Docker image
To run the Docker image, execute the following command:
```bash
$ docker run -d -t -p 10000:10000 -p 10001:10001 -p 10002:10002 -v /path/to/folder:/opt/azurite/folder arafato/azurite
```

#### Configure the executable when running the container
By default, the container starts all services available (currently blob, queue, and table).
Using the environment variable `executable`, specific executables can be specifed:

 * `blob` Start the Blob Storage Emulator only
 * `queue` Start the Azure Queue Storage Emulator only
 * `table` Start the Azure Table Storage Emulator only

##### Usage example:
```bash
$ docker run -e executable=blob -d -t -p 10000:10000 -v /path/to/folder:/opt/azurite/folder arafato/azurite
```

## Usage with Azure Cross-Platform CLI 2.0

To perform blob storage operations using the 2.0 Azure cross-platform CLI, you need to operate with the
appropriate connection string. The values within are based on the hardcoded Azure Storage Emulator values.

Example command to create a container:

```shell
$ az storage container create --name 'test' --connection-string 'DefaultEndpointsProtocol=http;AccountName=devstoreaccount1;AccountKey=Eby8vdM02xNOcqFlqUwJPLlmEtlCDXJ1OUzFT50uSRZ6IFsuFq2UVErCz4I6tq/K1SZFPTOtr/KBHBeksoGMGw==;BlobEndpoint=http://127.0.0.1:10000/devstoreaccount1;'

{
  "created": true
}
```

## Current List of Command Line Options

```
-a
``` 
Enables sharedkey authentication check
```
-l c:\tmp\emulatorPath
--location c:\tmp\emulatorPath
```

# Contributions
## What do I need to know to help?
If you are interested in making a code contribution and would like to learn more about the technologies that we use, check out the list below.

- Azurite runs on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). If you never worked with this technology before make sure to get yourself familiar with it. There are many [good tutorials](https://blog.risingstack.com/node-hero-tutorial-getting-started-with-node-js/) out there along with a [comprehensive API documentation](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v6.x/docs/api/) that will get you up to speed quickly! We are currently coding against Node.js v8.9.4 LTS 
- Azurite exposes its REST-based API via [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) which is a "fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js. 
- Azurite uses [LokiJS](http://lokijs.org) which is an in-memory data store with persistence. It serves as our central database to store metadata (names, properties, leases, etc.) about all objects put into Azurite.
- Azurite makes heavy use of [Bluebird](http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/getting-started.html) which is a fully featured promises library with unmatched performance.  

## What TODOs are there?
We are using a combination of community feedback, and the Azure Storage Node package tests to validate  Azurite's support of the [Official Blob Storage REST API Specification](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/blob-service-rest-api).  
We shall create issues based on failing tests to help direct and prioritize our development efforts.  
See also section below: [API Support](https://github.com/Azure/Azurite/#api-support).

Current bugs that need to be fixed are listed at our [issues site on Github](https://github.com/Azure/Azurite/issues) and tagged with a red label `bug`.

Issues which we think might  be a good place for newcomers to start, are tagged with [**"good first issue"**](https://github.com/Azure/Azurite/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

Details on how to setup tests with the Azure Storage submodule, can be found under [Testing with Azure Storage Node](./doc/azure-storage-node_tdd.md).  

## Need Help?

# API Support
Currently, Azurite only supports the [Blob Storage APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/fileservices/blob-service-rest-api), the [Queue Storage API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/queue-service-rest-api), and the [Table Storage API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/table-service-rest-api).  
Support for Azure Storage Files is planned, but currently not available. 

The Standard Emulator Connection String is the same as required by [Microsoft's Official Storage Emulator](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=717179):

`BlobEndpoint=http://127.0.0.1:10000/devstoreaccount1;`

`QueueEndpoint=http://127.0.0.1:10001/devstoreaccount1;`

`TableEndpoint=http://127.0.0.1:10002/devstoreaccount1;`

- Get Blob Service Stats [TODO]  
Retrieves statistics related to replication for the Blob service. This operation is only available on the secondary location endpoint when read-access geo-redundant replication is enabled for the storage account.
