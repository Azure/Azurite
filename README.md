## Introduction

Azurite is an open source Azure Storage API compatible server (emulator) based on Node.js. It provides cross platform experiences for customers wanting to try Azure Storage easily in a local environment. Azurite can simulate most of the commands supported by Azure Storage with minimal dependencies.

Azurite V2 is manually created with pure JavaScript, popular and active as an open source project. However, Azure Storage APIs are growing and keep being updated, therefore manually keeping Azurite up to date is not efficient and prone to bugs. JavaScript also lacks strong type validation which prevents easy collaboration.

Therefore, compared to V2, Azurite V3 implements a new architecture leveraging code generated by a TypeScript Server Code Generator we created. The generator uses the same swagger (modified) which is used by the new Azure Storage SDKs. This reduces manual effort and facilitates better code alignment with storage APIs.

3.0.0-preview is the first release version using Azurite's new architecture.

For a full list of all key changes and new features in V3, see [Features & Key Changes](documentation/key_changes_V3.md)

## Getting Started

Try with any of following ways to start an Azurite V3 instance (follow the links for detailed explanations).

### 1. GitHub

After cloning source code, execute following commands to install and start Azurite V3.

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
npm install -g
azurite
```


### 2. Visual Studio Code Extension

Azurite V3 can be installed from [Visual Studio Code extension market](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Azurite.azurite).
You can quickly start or close Azurite by clicking Azurite **status bar item** or following commands.

For all supported Visual Studio Code commands, see [Supported Commands](documentation/vscode-commands.md).


### 3. [NPM](documentation/getting_started_npm.md)

## Supported Command Line Options

Find a comprehensive list of all [command line options here](/documentation/commandline_options.md).

## Supported Environment Variable Options

Find a comprehensive list of all [supported environment variable options here](/documentation/environment_variable_options.md), which are supported for advanced customization when starting Azurite from npm command line `azurite` or docker image.


Azurite V3 allows customizing storage account names and keys by providing environment variable `AZURITE_ACCOUNTS` with format `account1:key1[:key2];account2:key1[:key2];...`.

For example, customize one storage account which has only one key:

```cmd
set AZURITE_ACCOUNTS="account1:key1"
```

Or customize multi storage accounts and each has 2 keys:

```cmd
set AZURITE_ACCOUNTS="account1:key1:key2;account2:key1:key2"
```

Azurite will refresh customized account name and key from environment variable every minute by default. With this feature, we can dynamically rotate account key, or add new storage accounts on the air without restarting Azurite instance.

> Note. Default storage account `devstoreaccount1` will be disabled when providing customized storage accounts.

> Note. The account keys must be base64 encoded string.

> Note. Should update connection string accordingly if using customized account name and key.

> Note. Use `export` keyword to set environment variable in Linux like environment, `set` in Windows.

### Customized Metadata Storage by External Database (Preview)

By default, Azurite leverages [loki](https://github.com/techfort/LokiJS) as metadata database.
However, as an in-memory database, loki limits Azurite's scalability and data persistency.
Set environment variable `AZURITE_DB=dialect://[username][:password][@]host:port/database` to make Azurite blob service switch to a SQL database based metadata storage, like MySql, SqlServer.

For example, connect to MySql or SqlServer by set environment variables:

```bash
set AZURITE_DB=mysql://username:password@localhost:3306/azurite_blob
set AZURITE_DB=mssql://username:password@localhost:1024/azurite_blob
```

When Azurite starts with above environment variable, it connects to the configured database, and creates tables if not exist.
This feature is in preview, when Azurite changes database table schema, you need to drop existing tables and let Azurite regenerate database tables.

> Note. Need to manually create database before starting Azurite instance.

> Note. Blob Copy & Page Blob are not supported by SQL based metadata implementation.

> Tips. Create database instance quickly with docker, for example `docker run --name mysql -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw -d mysql:latest`. Grant external access and create database `azurite_blob` using `docker exec mysql mysql -u root -pmy-secret-pw -e "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION; FLUSH PRIVILEGES; create database azurite_blob;"`. Notice that, above commands are examples, you need to carefully define the access permissions in your production environment.


## HTTPS Setup

Azurite natively supports HTTPS with self-signed certificates via the `--cert` and `--key`/`--pwd` options. You have two certificate type options: PEM or PFX. PEM certificates are split into "cert" and "key" files. A PFX certificate is a single file that can be assigned a password. Follow the according links for detailed explanations.

## Usage with Azure Storage SDKs or Tools


### Default Storage Account / Customized Storage Accounts & Keys

### Default Storage Account

Azurite V3 provides support for a default storage account as General Storage Account V2 and associated features.

- Account name: `devstoreaccount1`
- Account key: `Eby8vdM02xNOcqFlqUwJPLlmEtlCDXJ1OUzFT50uSRZ6IFsuFq2UVErCz4I6tq/K1SZFPTOtr/KBHBeksoGMGw==`

> Note. Besides SharedKey authentication, Azurite V3 supports account, OAuth, and service SAS authentication. Anonymous access is also available when container is set to allow public access.

### Customized Storage Accounts & Keys

As mentioned by above section. Azurite V3 allows customizing storage account names and keys by providing environment variable `AZURITE_ACCOUNTS` with format `account1:key1[:key2];account2:key1[:key2];...`. Account keys must be base64 encoded string.

For example, customize one storage account which has only one key:

```cmd
set AZURITE_ACCOUNTS="account1:key1"
```


See the [dedicated documentation](/documentation/default_customized_storage_account.md) for information on the default storage account and customization of storage account names and keys.

### Connection Strings

See the [dedicated documentation](/documentation/connection_strings.md) for information on the connection strings to the [Azure SDKs](https://aka.ms/azsdk) or tools (like Azure CLI 2.0 or Storage Explorer).

### Azure SDKs

See the [SDK documentation](documentation/sdk_guide.md), for details on how to use Azurite with the Azure SDKs.

### Storage Explorer

See the [Storage Explorer documentation](documentation/storage_explorer.md), for details on how to connect to Storage Explorer with Azurite HTTP or Azurite HTTPS (Connection String / Importing Certificates).

> Note. Delete above files and folders and restart Azurite to clean up Azurite. It will remove all data stored in Azurite!!

## Differences between Azurite and Azure Storage

See the [dedicated overview](/documenation/differences_azurite_azure-storage.md) of the differences between Azurite and Azure Storage.

## Differences between Azurite V3 and Azurite V2

Both Azurite V3 and Azurite V2 aim to provide a convenient emulation for customers to quickly try out Azure Storage services locally. There are lots of differences between Azurite V3 and legacy Azurite V2. 

For more information you can visit [Differences between Azurite V3 and Azurite V2](/documenation/differences_azurite_v3_v2.md).

## TypeScript Server Code Generator

Azurite V3 leverages a TypeScript Node.js Server Code Generator to generate the majority of code from Azure Storage REST APIs swagger specification.
Currently, the generator project is private, under development and only used by Azurite V3.
We have plans to make the TypeScript server generator public after Azurite V3 releases.
All the generated code is kept in `generated` folder, including the generated middleware, request and response models.

## Support Matrix

Latest release targets **2021-08-06** API version **blob** service.
