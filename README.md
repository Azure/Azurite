## Introduction

Azurite is an open source Azure Storage API compatible server (emulator) based on Node.js. Azurite provides cross platform experiences for customers wanting to try Azure Storage easily in a local environment. Azurite can simulate most of the commands supported by Azure Storage with minimal dependencies.

Azurite V2 is manually created with pure JavaScript, popular and active as an open source project. However, Azure Storage APIs are growing and keep being updated, therefore manually keeping Azurite up to date is not efficient and prone to bugs. JavaScript also lacks strong type validation which prevents easy collaboration.

Compared to V2, Azurite V3 implements a new architecture leveraging code generated by a TypeScript Server Code Generator we created. The generator uses the same swagger (modified) which is used by the new Azure Storage SDKs. This reduces manual effort and facilitates better code alignment with storage APIs.

3.0.0-preview is the first release version using Azurite's new architecture.

## Getting Started

Try with any of following ways to start an Azurite V3 instance (follow the links for detailed explanations).

### 1. GitHub

After cloning source code, execute following commands to install and start Azurite V3.

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
npm install -g
azurite
```


### 2. Visual Studio Code Extension

Azurite V3 can be installed from [Visual Studio Code extension market](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Azurite.azurite).
You can quickly start or close Azurite by clicking Azurite **status bar item** or following commands.

For all supported Visual Studio Code commands, see [Supported Commands](documentation/vscode-commands.md).


### 3. [NPM](documentation/getting_started_npm.md)


### 4. [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-azure-storage-azurite) 
#### - [see the docker image guide](documentation/docker_image_guide.md)


### 5. NuGet

_Releasing Azurite V3 to NuGet is under investigation._


### 6. Visual Studio

## Supported Command Line Options

Find a comprehensive list of all [command line options here](/documentation/commandline_options.md).

## Supported Environment Variable Options

Find a comprehensive list of all [supported environment variable options here](/documentation/environment_variable_options.md), which are supported for advanced customization when starting Azurite from npm command line `azurite` or docker image.


## HTTPS Setup

Azurite natively supports HTTPS with self-signed certificates via the `--cert` and `--key`/`--pwd` options. You have two certificate type options: PEM or PFX. PEM certificates are split into "cert" and "key" files. A PFX certificate is a single file that can be assigned a password. Follow the according links for detailed explanations.

## Differences between Azurite and Azure Storage

See the [dedicated documentation](/documenation/differences_azurite_azure-storage.md) for an overview of the differences between Azurite and Azure Storage.

## Differences between Azurite V3 and Azurite V2

Both Azurite V3 and Azurite V2 aim to provide a convenient emulation for customers to quickly try out Azure Storage services locally. There are lots of differences between Azurite V3 and legacy Azurite V2. For more information you can visit [Differences between Azurite V3 and Azurite V2](/documenation/differences_azurite_v3_v2.md).

## TypeScript Server Code Generator

Azurite V3 leverages a TypeScript Node.js Server Code Generator to generate the majority of code from Azure Storage REST APIs swagger specification.
Currently, the generator project is private, under development and only used by Azurite V3.
We have plans to make the TypeScript server generator public after Azurite V3 releases.
All the generated code is kept in `generated` folder, including the generated middleware, request and response models.

## Support Matrix

Latest release targets **2021-08-06** API version **blob** service.

See the [Detailed Support Matrix](documentation/support_matrix.md).
